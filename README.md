KubeSurvival allows you to **significantly reduce your Kubernetes costs** by finding the cheapest machines that successfully run your workloads.

If you have a multi-tenant environment, ML training jobs, a large number of ML model servers, etc, this tool can help you optimize your K8s compute costs.

To easily define workloads, KubeSurvival uses a very simple DSL:

```python
(
    # A service
    pod(cpu: 2, memory: "4Gi") + 

    # Another service - with 3 replicas
    pod(cpu: "500m", memory: "2Gi") * 3 +

    # More services!
    (
      pod(cpu: 2, memory: "4Gi") +
      pod(cpu: "250m", memory: "1Gi")
    ) * 3
) * 2  # Production, Staging
```

This will give you a result such as:

    Instance type: t3.medium
    Node count: 17
    Total Price per Month: USD $526.16

## Installation

Download a precompiled binary for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/aporia-ai/kubesurvival/releases) page.

Alternatively, if you have Go installed, you can run:

```console
$ go install github.com/aporia-ai/kubesurvival/v2
```

## Usage

To run KubeSurvival:

    ./kubesurvival config.yaml

See the [examples](examples/) directory for example config files.

## How does it work?

KubeSurvival uses [k8s-cluster-simulator](https://github.com/pfnet-research/k8s-cluster-simulator) to simulate Kubernetes pod scheduling, without running on the actual underlying machines. It iterates over all possible instance types and node counts, simulates a K8s cluster with your workload, and checks if there are any pending pods. 

For each simulation it calculates the on-demand cost per month using the [ec2-instances-info](https://github.com/cristim/ec2-instances-info) library. Additionally, it queries the [eni-max-pods.txt](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/files/eni-max-pods.txt) file to determine what's the maximum number of pods in each instance type.

Finally, KubeSurvival selects the cheapest configuration without pending pods.

## What's missing from this?

Well... a lot actually. Here's a partial list:

* Support for AKS and GKE
* Support for calculating costs of EBS storages
* Support for different node groups (e.g 2 machines with GPU + 4 machines without GPU)
* and probably much more!

We would love your help! ‚ù§Ô∏è
